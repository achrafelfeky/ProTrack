# 🧩 Project Management & Task Tracking API

This project is built using **Django REST Framework (DRF)**.  
It provides a complete backend system for managing projects, tasks, and members — with **role-based access**, **notifications**, and **full caching** for optimized performance.

## 🚀 Features

1. 👥 **Role-Based Members** — Each project can have members with different roles (Manager, Member, Admin).  
2. 📝 **Task Assignment** — Tasks can be assigned to one or multiple users.  
3. 🔒 **Role Permissions** —  
   - **Managers** can create and track tasks, assign members, and update task status.  
   - **Members** can only view and comment on their assigned tasks.  
4. 🔔 **Smart Notifications** —  
   - When a user is added to a project.  
   - When assigned a new task.  
   - When a deadline is approaching.  
   - When a task or project is marked as **Done**.  
5. 💬 **Task Comments** — Each user can comment only on their assigned tasks.  
6. 🧪 **Full Testing Coverage** — Unit tests for all main functionalities.  
7. 📊 **Dashboards** —  
   - Admin & Manager: view all assigned and created tasks.  
   - Regular users: view only their own tasks.  
8. ⏳ **Task Review Flow** — Tasks go through status changes:  
   *Pending → In Progress → Review → Done*  
   The manager or owner can accept, reject, or request edits before marking as **Done**.  
9. ⚡ **Advanced Caching System (NEW)** —  
   - Implemented **caching for all API endpoints** (projects, tasks, members, dashboards, etc.).  
   - Uses **Django Cache Framework** (can be backed by Redis or memory cache).  
   - Greatly improves performance and reduces database load.  
   - Automatic cache invalidation when data changes (create/update/delete).
